# CPTracker-sprites

These are sprite image files for crossproduct's ALttPR Tracker created with SpriteAnimator and then hand-edited.

To use one of those sprites, just replace the tunic and tunicbunny png-files in the "/images/items"-folder of the tracker with the files of your choice.

If you have questions or feedback of some sort, you can message
me on GitHub (FirenX) or on Discord (Feed4Fame#7342).

Special thanks to fatmanspanda, creator of the amazing
SpriteAnimator
and the creators of these sprites.
